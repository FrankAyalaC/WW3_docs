WAVEWATCH
*********

WAVEWATCHIII v6.07 is hosted in Github. Github is a Git repository hosting service and Git is a free, open and well-known source distributed version control system. Because it is a open project, the modelling community can both clone the newest or any version WW3 and contribuite to the development of WW3 from the creation of new features to the bugs and errors handling. For more information you can visit (link)
 
It is recommended to review the availiable information of the `WW3 repository <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3>`_. In a specific section you can view all releases WW3 and a brief description of each one.

To clone the WW3 repository implies to do a copy of project from Github. To clone type the following command in your terminal from the directory where you want download WW3 source code. It must be installed git (on linux/ubuntu is installed by default)

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3	

The previous command line will download a folder called ``WW3`` in the directory where it was cloned. This folder contains this structure:


* ``manual``: the manual directory, here are the .tex files that build the manual WW3.
* ``model``: model source code, here the files are built after the compilation (FORTRAN modules, etc.), template input files to execute the model, etc.
	* ``bin``: this folder contains the neccesary executable programs to compile WW3.   
	* ``aux``: Raw auxiliary programs fo the compilation WW3
	* ``ftn``: All FORTRAN files (source code)
	* ``inp`` : input files
	* ``nml``: namelist input files
	* ``mod``: module files (created only after the compilation)
	* ``obj``: object files (created only after the compilation)
	* ``exe``: executable files (created only after the compilation) 
* ``regtests``: WW3 test cases
* ``guide``: a guide to WW3 in .tex files
* ``smc_docs``: documentacion and files to SMC grids

Additionally, from your top-level- directory (``path/to/WW3/model/``) you can type: 

**explain about to type .file referring to exexuctbale shell files in Linux**

.. code-block:: bash

    ./model/bin/ww3_from_ftp.sh

With this instructions you can get the binary and large files used for WW3 test cases in ``regtest`` directory. With this ub the top-level directory you could get two folder more:

* ``cases``:
* ``data_regtests``: data necessart to execution some regtests

Also, in this directory there is a hidden folder ``.git``, which is created by default when a Github repository is cloned on your local machine, a licence file, .gitignore file (to exclude same files) and README.md file to desribe instructions.

Gridgen
*******

Gridgen is a MATLAB program to create files that contain bathimethric information to be used in WW3. this program is also hosteed in Github and you can obtain with:

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/gridgen
