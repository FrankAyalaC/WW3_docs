WAVEWATCH
*********

WAVEWATCHIII v6.07 is hosted in Github. Github is a Git repository hosting service and Git is a free, open and well-known source distributed version control system. Because it is a open project, the modelling community can both clone the newest or any version WW3 and contribuite to the development of WW3 from the creation of new features to the bugs and errors handling. For more information you can visit (link)
 
It is recommended to review the availiable information of the `WW3 repository <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3>`_. In a specific section you can view all releases WW3 and a brief description of each one.

To clone the WW3 repository implies to do a copy of project from Github. To clone type the following command in your terminal from the directory where you want download WW3 source code. It must be installed git (on linux/ubuntu is installed by default)

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3	

The previous command line will download a folder called ``WW3`` in the directory where it was cloned. This folder contains this structure:

* ``manual``: the manual directory, here are the .tex files that build the manual WW3. 
* ``model``: model source code, here the files are built after the compilation (FORTRAN modules, etc.), template input files to execute the model, etc.

	* ``bin``: this folder contains the neccesary executable programs to compile WW3.   
	* ``aux``: Raw auxiliary programs fo the compilation WW3.
	* ``ftn``: All FORTRAN files (source code).
	* ``inp``: input files.		
	* ``nml``: namelist input files.
	* ``mod``: module files (created only after the compilation).
	* ``obj``: object files (created only after the compilation).
	* ``exe``: executable files (created only after the compilation) .

* ``regtests``: WW3 test cases.
* ``guide``: a guide to WW3 in .tex files.
* ``smc_docs``: documentacion and files to SMC grids.

Additionally, from your top-level- directory (``path/to/WW3/model/``) you can execute ``ww3_from_ftp.sh`` located in ``bin`` folder:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./model/bin/ww3_from_ftp.sh

.. hint::
	
	To execute a file on Linux/Ubuntu you have the following options:
	- type ``.`` and then the ``path/to/executable/file/``
	- type ``sh path/to/executable/file/``
	- type ``bash path/to/executable/file/``

With this instructions you can get the binary and large files used for WW3 test cases in ``regtest`` directory. With this ub the top-level directory you could get two folder more:

* ``cases``:
* ``data_regtests``: data necessary for the execution some regtests

Also, in this directory there is a hidden folder ``.git``, which is created by default when a Github repository is cloned on your local machine, a licence file, .gitignore file (to exclude same files) and README.md file to desribe instructions.


*******
Gridgen
*******

Gridgen is a MATLAB program to create files that contain bathimethric information to be used in WW3. This program is also hosted in Github, you can visit the repository (LINK) and obtain it in your local computer with (TALK MORE ABOUT GRIDGEN):

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/gridgen

This command line will download a folder called ``gridgen`` in the directory where it was cloned. This folder contains this structure:
	
- ``bin``:
- ``examples``:
- ``manual``:
- ``reference_data``:

Later, you must cd to ``reference_data`` and type: 

.. code-block:: bash

    wget ftp://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/tempor/ww3ftp/gridgen_addit.tgz

This will unpack the netcdf batymetry files: 

  - etopo1.nc 
  - etopo2.nc 

and matlab binary files: 

  - coastal_bound_coarse.mat
  - coastal_bound_high.mat   
  - coastal_bound_low.mat
  - coastal_bound_full.mat    
  - coastal_bound_inter.mat  
  - optional_coastal_polygons.mat

For more information, it's recommended to visit the oficial web repository.

OASIS-MCT
*********

.. warning::

	If you are interested in coupling WW3 with other climate models (ice, ocean or atmosphere model) this step is necessary. If you are not, please skip it.

The OASIS is a software coupler that allows synchronizing exchanges of information between numerical codes and it's specially used to represent different components of the climate system. Current OASIS developers are CERFACS (Toulouse, France) and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS (Paris, France)

Due to this coupler must be interfaced, Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT) from the Argonne National Laboratory is used. This offers a fully parallel implementation of coupling field regridding and exchange. OASIS-MCT is a coupling library is linked with to the component models with the main function of interpolation and exchanging the coupling fields between these components.

If you want download any OASIS-MCT version, please visit the OASIS download site (LINK), after filling out the registration form, you can obtain the source code with:

# WAY 1

or 

# WAY 2

This folder contains this structure: 
	
- ``doc``: OASIS-MCT documentation in .tex files. 
- ``examples``: tutorials and basic examples for beginners in OASIS-MCT complation.
- ``lib``: FORTRAN files used to the OASIS-MCT compilation. 
- ``util``: editable Make files to adjust the local conditions to the OASIS-MCT compilation.

more information is available in LINK.
